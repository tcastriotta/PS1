# Problem Set 1 for Big Data Class
## Due: 9/24/2023

## Group problem set 
For this project you will work in groups of 2. You can choose your pair. This will test your skills for collaborating on Github. 

## Problem Set description
In this problem set, you will experiment with cleaning a messy dataset and producing some basic results. You will replicate graphs from the paper [Diversifying Societyâ€™s Leaders? The Determinants and Causal Effects of Admission to Highly Selective Private Colleges](https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CollegeAdmissions_Paper.pdf) by Raj Chetty, David J. Deming, and John N. Friedman (and a variety of co-authors). This working paper uses anonymized admissions data from 139 elite colleges linked to income tax records to ask whether these highly selective schools show a preference for high-income students beyond SAT/ACT scores and the effect of attending one of these schools on future earnings. 

See a [non-technical summary](https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CollegeAdmissions_Nontech.pdf) and a [New York Times report](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/07/24/upshot/ivy-league-elite-college-admissions.html) for more information. Please familiarize yourself with this working paper. 

I have provided starter code, which you will use to complete this project. The code includes:

- `housekeeping.R`
- `download_data.R`
- `clean_data.R`
- `PS1_writeup.Rmd`

The problem set questions are in ps1_writeup.Rmd. 

## Grading
I will be grading this problem set based on the following criteria:
- Quality of code (33%): Is it well-commented? Is it easy to follow? Can I run it?
- Quality of graphs (33%): Are they well-labeled? Do they have titles? Do they have legends? Are they formatted well?
- Quality of answers (33%): Are they clear? Do they answer the question?
